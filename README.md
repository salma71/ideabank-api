# README

## Under development
## REQUIREMENTS
* The code should be written in ES6 as much as possible
* Use the create-react-app generator to start your project.
* Follow the instructions on this repo to setup the generator: create-react-app
* Your app should have one HTML page to render your react-redux application
* There should be 2 container components
* There should be 5 stateless components
* There should be 3 routes
* The Application must make use of react-router and proper RESTful routing (should you choose to use react-router v3 please refer to the appropriate docs; docs for v4 can be found here)
* Use Redux middleware to respond to and modify state change
* Make use of async actions to send data to and receive data from a server
* Your Rails API should handle the data persistence. You should be using fetch() within your actions to GET and POST data from your API - do not use jQuery methods.
* Your client-side application should handle the display of data with minimal data manipulation
* Your application should have some minimal styling: feel free to stick to a framework (like react-bootstrap), but if you want to write (additional) CSS yourself, go for it!

<!-- This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions
